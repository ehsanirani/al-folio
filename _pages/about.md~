Welcome to my personal page. I finished my studies in physics at [Georg-August-Universität Göttingen](http://www.uni-goettingen.de) and now are working as a post-doctoral researcher in the [Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine](http://www.mdc-berlin.de) in Berlin, Germany. I am generally interested in science, computers, human related stuff like politics etc. Some of my research interests and science activities are listed in [projects](projects).
